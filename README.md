## üì± Mobile Software Engineer

With extensive experience in mobile application development, I possess a strong track record of creating impactful applications that have been utilized by millions worldwide, including [mobile.de](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.mobile.android.app&hl=en_US) while it was under eBay ownership. My wealth of experience has honed my ability to handle projects of any scale and complexity with unwavering confidence.

In my software development philosophy, I strike a harmonious blend between robust platform development and a user-centric approach. As a platform developer, I excel in designing modular applications with developer-friendly APIs, laying a strong foundation for scalable and maintainable codebases.

At the same time, I am deeply committed to crafting products that resonate with users. My product-oriented mindset enables me to empathize with end-users, translating their needs into intuitive and delightful experiences.

## üíª Backend API & Web Development

In addition to mobile development, I've honed my skills in backend API development using Node.js and AWS. This combination of front-end and back-end expertise allows me to have a broad understanding of software development life cycle.

## üåå Data Engineering Enthusiast

Data is the core foundation of all our decisions, fueling our understanding and driving innovation. This has ignited a deep interest in data engineering within me, and I dedicate my free time to exploring this vast and fascinating domain.

Beyond data collection and storage mechanics, I find immense joy in the art of data analysis. Unraveling insights from complex datasets presents a thrilling challenge, empowering me to make informed decisions that can drive real-world solutions.

The boundless potential of data engineering in addressing practical problems serves as a constant motivation for my learning and growth in this field. I eagerly embrace the opportunities to enhance my expertise and contribute meaningfully to the world of data engineering.

## ‚ö° Personal Projects

I hold a firm belief that learning is an endless journey, and one of the most effective ways to continue this quest is through personal projects. These projects serve as a platform where I can venture into unexplored ideas, technologies, and methodologies. It's a realm where I fearlessly challenge myself, embracing mistakes as valuable opportunities for learning.

Presently, my focus lies in an open-source initiative‚Äîa [science quiz platform](https://github.com/SciQuizHero) accessible via native [iOS](https://github.com/SciQuizHero/SciQuizHero-iOS-client.git) and [Android](https://github.com/SciQuizHero/SciQuizHero-Android-client.git) applications. This endeavor reflects the seamless fusion of my passion for software engineering and education. The ultimate goal is to make science learning a thrilling experience through gamification.

If you're curious about the progress on this project or any others, feel free to explore my GitHub profile. I welcome any feedback or contributions to the code with utmost appreciation! Together, we can make learning an inspiring adventure.
